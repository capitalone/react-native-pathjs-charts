This library is a cross-platform (iOS/Android) library of charts/graphs using [react-native-svg](https://github.com/magicismight/react-native-svg) and [paths-js](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-js) based on the excellent work done by Roman Samec in the [react-pathjs-chart](https://github.com/rsamec/react-pathjs-chart) library. The project is an early attempt at providing a ubiquitous solution for charts & graphs for React Native that offer a unified view across devices.

Components include Pie charts, Bar charts, Smoothline charts, Stockline charts, Scatterplots, Tree graphs and Radar graphs. Since Paths-Js makes no assumptions about rendering, this library is perfect for using SVG path objects to render custom charts easily.

This library is in its early stages, but I welcome contributors who would like to help make this the charting solution for React Native. Many of our mobile experiences need to create dashboards. Up to now, we've only been seeing libraries that are native bridges. Wouldn't it be great to have a cross platform solution that just worked?

## Installation

To add the library to your React Native project:

```
npm install react-native-pathjs-charts --save
react-native link react-native-svg
```

For further information, see the [wiki](https://github.com/capitalone/react-native-pathjs-charts/wiki)


## Current Features

+ Pie, Bar, Smoothline, Stockline, Scatterplot, Tree and Radar graphs
+ Configuration of format, labels, colors, axis, ticks, lines
+ No touch support (yet)
+ No animations (yet)
+ Chart information configurable based on data parameters which specify which variables are accessors
+ Rendering works on iOS/Android
+ No native dependencies for linking (except linking required by [react-native-svg](https://github.com/magicismight/react-native-svg))

## Example Application

To run the example application (from a cloned repo):

```
cd example
npm install
react-native link react-native-svg
react-native run-ios
# or
react-native run-android
```

### Developing and Testing With The Example App

Please see the [util/watchman-update-example-src/README.md](util/watchman-update-example-src/README.md) for information on how to setup a [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)-based file watch that automates source file copying between [project source](src) and the [example app](example) to make manual testing easier


## Todo

For this library to really shine, there are a lot of improvements to be made. Here are some of my top ideas:
+ Add basic animations to draw the charts
+ Add touch functionality (as the react-native-svg library adds touch features)
+ Add the ability to absolutely position regular React-Native views in relation to SVG chart elements
+ More chart types
+ More axis controls (to control scale)
+ Add View component support to allow custom components instead of message when no data appears
+ Events
+ More documentation, information on configuration
+ Extended examples
+ Bug fixing, unit testing, cleanup
+ CICD pipeline with confirmed build success
